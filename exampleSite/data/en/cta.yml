  title: What is TEDx?
  content: In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called
    TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together
    to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxCowes, where x = independently
    organized TED event. At our TEDxCowes event, TED Talks video and live speakers
    will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED
    Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
    events, including ours, are self-organized.
