Watch [Why TEDxCowes](https://youtu.be/2i1-ZDMOARE), in the words of the Organiser Leonardo Zangrando. Why and how it came to be, as a way to multiply our impact on ocean sustainability well beyond what each one can do individually. 

And this became the theme of the event itself «Ocean : Inspire» – Inspiring people multiply their personal impact on Ocean Sustainability. 

Follow TEDxCowes on all social media channels for updates on the event and to watch it live on 4th November 2021 or in live streaming. Soon you'll be able to apply for an invite to the live event in Cowes.
