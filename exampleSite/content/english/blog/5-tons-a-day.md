TEDxCowes speaker Rolf-Ørjan Høgset shows us his team's work collecting plastic from the coasts of Norway in this [unedited Zoom video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWAqQW0Lk_I). 

3 large containers get filled every couple of days with all sorts of plastics. Most of it is recyclable and Rolf's team make a great job of sorting the pieces that can be recycled straight away, from those that need further processing. 

Unfortunately at the end there remains some plastic that is not recyclable, which will be sent to incinerate to extract the energy it is storing. 

We must stop CONSUMING plastic as a disposable. Plastic can be a great resource, if managed so that it is used time and again and then recycled time and again. There is no room for disposable plastic.

Why are we doing this to ourselves? 

Join us at TEDxCowes this 4th November, online and live at the Island Sailing Club in Cowes. We can multiply exponentially our personal impact by taking action.
