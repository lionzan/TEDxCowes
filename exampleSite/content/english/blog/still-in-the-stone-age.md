TEDxSpeaker Vincent Doumeizel tells us why we are still in the Stone Age in the way we use the Ocean resources, check the [video](https://youtu.be/77Fv1hdWJeQ) here.

Our civilsation evolved from the stone age when we learned first to farm crops, and then to use crops to feed animals. 

In the Ocean we are doing it the other way around, starting from farming animals and feeding them with land-produced food, instead of farming seaweed. 

This is not only an interesting perspective, but a powerful statement to rethink the way we look at Ocean farming and move into seaweed farming. 

As citizens we can have our say by accepting and consuming seaweed related food.
